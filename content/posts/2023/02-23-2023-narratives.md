### Birthdays

NarrativeSZN has some high profile birthday plays. I'm also experiementing with adding stats from previous birthday performances if the individual played on their last birthday.

First up, we have Jamaal Murray of the Denver Nuggets with his stats from last year:

| Points | Rebounds | Assists | Steals | Blocks | Turnovers | DK Points | FD Points |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 24     | 5        | 8       | 2      | 1      | 2         | 49.75     | 50        |

Our next birthday boy is D'Angelo Russell of the Lakers. He last played on his birthday in 2019, the stats can be found below:

| Points | Rebounds | Assists | Steals | Blocks | Turnovers | DK Points | FD Points |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 40    | 1        | 7       | 2      | 1      | 4         | 58.75     | 56.70        |

Finally, we have Andrew Wiggins of Golden State checking in with birthday stats in 2021 of the following: 

| Points | Rebounds | Assists | Steals | Blocks | Turnovers | DK Points | FD Points |
